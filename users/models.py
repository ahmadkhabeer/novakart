Of course. I have analyzed the two versions of users/models.py and the overall project structure.

Your current users/models.py is completely empty, while the suggested version introduced a Profile model but kept the ShippingAddress model in the orders app.

For better logical consistency and to truly build a robust user account system, the ShippingAddress model belongs in the users app. A user "owns" their addresses, and an Order simply "points to" one of those addresses when it's created.

Here is the definitive, rewritten version of the users app, including the final models, views, and URLs.

1. The Better and Final users/models.py
This version is the most logical and scalable. It moves ShippingAddress into the users app and establishes a clear Profile model.

Action: Replace the entire content of users/models.py with this code.

Python

# users/models.py

from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class Profile(models.Model):
    """
    Extends the default User model to store additional information.
    """
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Example future fields:
    # phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True)
    # profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='users/pictures', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username}'s Profile"

# Signal to create a Profile automatically when a new User is created.
@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)

@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def save_user_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()


class ShippingAddress(models.Model):
    """
    Stores a shipping address, owned by a specific user.
    """
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='addresses')
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    address_line_1 = models.CharField("Address Line 1", max_length=255)
    address_line_2 = models.CharField("Address Line 2", max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    state_province_region = models.CharField("State/Province/Region", max_length=100)
    postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    is_default = models.BooleanField(default=False, help_text="Is this the default shipping address?")

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "Shipping Address"
        verbose_name_plural = "Shipping Addresses"
        ordering = ['-is_default']

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username} - {self.address_line_1}, {self.city}"

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Ensure only one address can be the default
        if self.is_default:
            self.user.addresses.all().update(is_default=False)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
